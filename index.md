Was it a Love Boat or No's Ark,

As stories suppressed came out of dark,

When Yes went high, the No went Lowe,

But the {% include lightbox-anchor.html text="gasp of the crowd" targetid="saoirsetweet" title="Image of Saoirse Long PKLive tweet" %} did steal the show.

For our sisters, our daughters, our girl friends, our mothers,

Politicians did us proud, some more than others,

The home to vote heroes,

That came just in time,

Some [got Taytos](https://twitter.com/AoifeNiRaif/status/999739576162963457),

As they waited in line.

Searching for truth, amongst liars and cheaters,

Our guiding light was the [thought of Savita](https://twitter.com/Together4yes/status/1001010635872849920),

The women made fly, the women made die,

They shared their stories, they made us cry.

<br />

<br />

With the vote came the nerves,

Came the fear of polls,

But turnout they did,

Both young and old.

<br />
<hr style="width: 30%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<br />

A result that shocked,

Ushered in a new era,

A changing land,

Was instantly nearer.

<br />
<hr style="width: 30%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<br />

A girl Ireland rejected,

Now knows she's accepted,

No longer alone,

She is finally home.
